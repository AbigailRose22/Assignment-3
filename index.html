            <h1>Viva La Vida!</h1>
            <p>I used to rule the world
                Seas would rise when I gave the word
                Now in the morning, I sleep alone
                Sweep the streets I used to own
                I used to roll the dice
                Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
                Listened as the crowd would sing
                "Now the old king is dead, long live the king"
                One minute I held the key
                Next, the walls were closed on me
                And I discovered that my castles stand
                Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
                I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
                Roman cavalry choirs are singing
                Be my mirror, my sword and shield
                My missionaries in a foreign field
                For some reason, I can't explain
                Once you'd gone, there was never
                Never an honest word
                And that was when I ruled the world
                It was a wicked and wild wind
                Blew down the doors to let me in
                Shattered windows and the sound of drums
                People couldn't believe what I'd become
                Revolutionaries wait
                For my head on a silver plate
                Just a puppet on a lonely string
                Oh, who would ever want to be king?
                I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
                Roman cavalry choirs are singing
                Be my mirror, my sword and shield
                My missionaries in a foreign field
                For some reason, I can't explain
                I know Saint Peter won't call my name
                Never an honest word
                But that was when I ruled the world
                Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
                Roman cavalry choirs are singing
                Be my mirror, my sword and shield
                My missionaries in a foreign field
                For some reason, I can't explain
                I know Saint Peter won't call my name
                Never an honest word
                But that was when I ruled the world</p>
